Code Tierlist
</h1>

Ever wondered when you complete an assignment and do not know how well you're doing compared to other students? Introducing the Code Tierlist!

We provide to give users(students) an opportunity as the leading place to test your code for students to know their progress compared to their peers while they are working on their assignments, making coding more **interactive**, **fun**, and **easier**.

On Code Tierlist, instructors can create new projects (assignments) for students. In each project, students are able to upload their own test cases and code, how well students do will be based on the accuracy of the students code in their own test cases, this will be shown in a tier list for students to see.

Follow along below to ✨**learn more**✨:
